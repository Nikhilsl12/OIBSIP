# Oasis infobyte Virtual Internship

This repository contains the solutions for the tasks completed during the oasis infobyte Virtual Internship. The internship consisted of three tasks: Number Game, Student Grade Calculator, and ATM Interface.

## Number Game
The Number Game task involved creating a program that generates a random number and allows the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

## ATM Interface
The ATM Interface task involved creating a user-friendly interface for an ATM machine. The interface allows users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing money, checking account balance, transaction history and transferring funds.

Each task is implemented as a separate module within this repository.
